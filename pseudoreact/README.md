# Not a part of the submission for test assignment

This is an attemt to create a single-page-application frontend in vanilla JS (+TS).

**It is just a fun side-project and shouldn't be used by anyone.**

To try, place dist files (build if needed) backend folder and start backend containers: from project's root run

```
$ docker compose up -d
```

For v4 you can run `yarn dev` to launch Vite devserver (but you still have to start backend).
